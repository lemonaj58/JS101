/* setting and clearing breakpoints
we can set the debugger keyword in a file to set up a breakpoint. but
that can be a slow way if you are already in the debugger.
another way we can set up a breakpoint is setBreakpoint(), or sb()

to remover that breakpoint clearBreakpoint() or cb() commands.

setBreakpoint or sb, can be used without an arguement or with one
if without arguement the breakpoint will be on the current line.

if with an arguement it is using the line that you are assigning it to.

clearBreakpoint or cb takes two arguments;
the name of the file,
and the line number.
