//for the best results for the lesson follow these approaches.

/* break down the problem as well as you can. also dont feel like
i have to get it exactly correct the first time. do problems again
in a better way than it was.

-map out the problem in a flow chart usuing sub-processes to encapsulate
distinc components of the problem.

-when you;re ready to tackle a component wright psuedo code for the proccess.
it will take more than one function for the task so be ready to understand
the inputs and outputs of the program.

-play around with the code while you write it down. dont feel like you
have to copy the exact way they write down the problem.

-dont be afraid to do the walkthroughs but dont just read then without writing
code. write along if you follow step by step for the code.
